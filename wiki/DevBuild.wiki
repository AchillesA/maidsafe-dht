#summary Developer Build Instructions

*Introduction*

Please ensure you have boost installed (version 1_37) as well as google gtest and protocol bufferes. these are all the libraries required. 

To build the project you will require to have cmake installed and in your path. 

= Details =
*Linux*


1: Download the maidsafe-dht src.

2: cd to build dir for linux [src/build/Linux]

3: run cmake ../../

4: run *make* (this will make all]
   run *make tests* - for all tests
   run *make Experimental* (to configure build test and upload to dashboard)
   run *make package* for auto rpm or deb [on windows creates installer]
   run *make install* to install library and API headers
   etc.

Notes:
Make sure there is no old version of protocol buffers installed (e.g. v2.0.1)
You MUST have gcc43 installed

*Windows*
##############
#*mingw - current* 

#This can run alongside your visual studio implementation - uses c:\usr\lib etc 

#rather than MSVC c:\lib\ so wont mess with your libraries

#Do all these commands from the BUILD_DIR in your code

1: download - wintools.zip

2: unzip wintools.zip and install tdm-mingw and add to path.(select this at install)

3: Install msys [when asked for interface with mingw - select y - then type c:/MinGW as location]

4: This will install a Msys icon on your desktop [only build mingw libs with this - i.e. not our programs]

5: go to /<location of your sources>/BUILD_FILES/ [note cd /c/ is c drive cd /d/ is d drive etc.]

6: type ./winbuild.sh ( take a rest for a couple of hours while the environment is built)

7: Make sure the c:/usr/lib dir gets a copy of dokan.lib and dokan.exp (from subversion)

8: Install codeblocks - you can include mingw from there if you want - but not necessary. [ I would include the contrib nsis stuff for later on - but again not necessary]

9: Install NSIS (allow you to build an installer)

10: open command prompt start->run->cmd <enter>

11: go to build/win dir in subversion

12 type cmake ..\..\ -G"CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles" <enter>

13 Open codeblocks and work away 

all usual suspects are available - instead of typing make type mingw32-make - apart from that you have all the usual targets
mingw32-make [build everything]
mingw32-make perpetualdata [build only that target]
mingw32-make Experimental [build everything and report to dashboard]
mingw32-make package [ builds installer ] 
mingw32-make tests [builds and runs test suite ]
etc.

#*MSVC - deprecated*

all thats needed is really 

dowload and unpack http:://www.maidsafe.net/winfiles.zip

This contains all libs and headers needed - unzip this to c:\ (givine c:\lib c:\include etc.)

That should install all libraries needed - just need to make sure you have protoc compiler downloaded 
from google and a copy of visual studio express 2008 installed also.

1: go to build dir for windows [trunk/build/Win]
2: run windowscmake.bat
3: run nmake (this will make all]
   run nmake tests - for all tests
   run nmake Experimental (to configure build test and upload to dashboard)
   run nmake package to create windows installer
   etc.
