#summary Immediate TODO list
#labels Phase-Requirements,TODO

= Introduction =

Urgent TODO items. We are releasing this code as is at the moment, it *does* work although its messy at the moment. We are cleaning and creating an appropriate interface as a matter of urgency, please feel free to send us patches - *we need your help*.

Thanks

= Details =

 # Allow bandwidth up/download limits, reporting and quotas.
 # Add checks for change in local and external IP addresses.
 # Implement effective logging (use Google glog for this). We need a way to compile GLOG on MinGW to have logging on Windows.
 # Implement installer for Linux, windows and OS/X (cmake handles this effectively)
 # Remove *boost asio libraries*. They are currently used to obtain the address from local network interfaces.
 # Remove ALL compiler warnings. Most compiler warnings we have are now in the cryptopp library. Removal involves submitting of the patches to the creators 
 # Get to as close to 100% test coverage ASAP
 # Implement a full errno.h file to handle errors more effectively.



As we said before, *all help appreciated*. All work *must* be submitted as a patch and to Google coding standards (we use internally) which can be found at  http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml
