= Introduction =

Urgent TODO items. We are releasing this code as is at the moment, it *does* work although its messy at the moment. We are cleaning and creating an appropriate interface as a matter of urgency, please feel free to send us patches - *we need your help*

Thanks


= Details =

 # Create an effective API 
  # Allow a use UPnP (bool)
  # Allow bandwidth up/download limits, reporting and quota's 
 # Rewrite UPnP (this is very messy and uses RTTI) 
 # Add checkes for change in local and external IP addresses. This should be achieved by:
  # Checking messages are being recieved at least on per 2 secs
   * if not send a whoami to the node we bootstrapped off, on fail re-bootstrap AND ping every node in routing table starting with closest buckets. Also check at same time local IP address never altered with a local IP address check.
 # Implement effective logging
 # Rewrite get local ip and port to use UDT functions
 # Remove boost asio libraries
 # Remove ALL compiler warnings
 # Improve all tests to use only random ports and files for testing (i.e. write proper tests :-) ) 
 
These are the main block issues at the moment, the first 3 are essential for any production system - and as we say, *all help appreciated*
