= Introduction =

We are releasing this code as is at the moment; it *does* work although it's a bit messy just now. We are cleaning and creating an appropriate interface as a matter of urgency. Please feel free to send us [http://code.google.com/p/maidsafe-dht/wiki/Patches patches] - *we need your help*.

Thanks.

= Items in TODO list =

  # Allow bandwidth up/download limits, reporting and quotas.
  # Add checks for change in local and external IP addresses.
  # Kademlia caching.
  # A stable delete operation (we are aware that this would extend the current operations of the DHT).
  # Compilation of [http://code.google.com/p/google-glog/downloads/list Google-glog] on MinGW to enable logging on Windows.
  # Implement installer for Linux, Windows and OS/X (CMake handles this effectively).
  # Remove ALL compiler warnings. Most compiler warnings we have are now in the [http://www.cryptopp.com cryptopp library]. Removal involves submission of the patches to the creators and monitoring of their acceptance.
  # Get as close to 100% test coverage ASAP.

As we said before, *all help appreciated*. Please check our [http://code.google.com/p/maidsafe-dht/wiki/Patches patches wiki] for guidelines on the quality of the code expected.
