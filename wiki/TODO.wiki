= Introduction =

We are releasing this code as is at the moment, it *does* work although its messy at the moment. We are cleaning and creating an appropriate interface as a matter of urgency, please feel free to send us patches - *we need your help*.

Thanks

= Items in TODO list =

  # Allow bandwidth up/download limits, reporting and quotas.
  # Add checks for change in local and external IP addresses.
  # Kademlia caching.
  # A stable delete operation (we are aware that this would extend the current operations of the DHT).
  # Compilation GLOG on MinGW to have logging on Windows.
  # Implement installer for Linux, Windows and OS/X (cmake handles this effectively)
  # Remove *boost asio libraries*. They are currently used to obtain the address from local network interfaces.
  # Remove ALL compiler warnings. Most compiler warnings we have are now in the cryptopp library. Removal involves submitting of the patches to the creators and monitoring of their acceptance.
  # Get to as close to 100% test coverage ASAP.

As we said before, *all help appreciated*. Please check our *Patches* wiki for guidelines to the quality of the code expected.
